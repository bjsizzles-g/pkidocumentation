#PKI Documentation:


We are looking at feasibility study on the usage of PKI certs from HashiCorp Vault to connect to a Windows server. 
We will need to ensure that the Windows server is configured to accept client certificates for authentication. 
We will also need to configure the client (e.g., your application or tool) to present the certificate when connecting to the Windows server. 

# Configuration needed at Windows Side:

Steps Needed:

1. Install the Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate:

If you haven't already, install the root CA certificate (the one used to sign the client certificates) on the Windows server.
You can do this by importing the certificate into the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store using the Certificate Manager (certmgr.msc).

2. Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\ClientCert -Value $true
